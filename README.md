# seer
Sequence element enrichment analysis. This document contains
installation instuctions. Usage can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/johnlees/seer/wiki/Usage), and more information in the [paper](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12797).

## Installation
### Use a pre-compiled release

Head to the [release](https://github.com/johnlees/seer/releases) page and download and unpack the tarball. If you have the dependencies installed use the dynamic version, otherwise use the static version (tested on Ubuntu only; static_all should work on other 64-bit Linux platforms).

### Use on a virtual machine

We have a virtual machine, containing SEER and other useful bioinformatics programs, which is available at
ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/pathogens-vm/pathogens-vm.latest.ova
and can be imported as an appliance in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

### Compile source code

First clone the repository

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/johnlees/seer

If you already have dlib:

    git clone https://github.com/johnlees/seer

Currently tested on Linux only, installation should proceed as

    make
    make install

Full installation instructions are available <a href="#installation-on-ubuntubiolinux">below</a>

## Dependencies
seer currently depends on

- gzstream <http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/compgeom/gzstream/>
- armadillo <http://arma.sourceforge.net/>
- boost <http://www.boost.org/>
- dlib <http://www.dlib.net/>
- HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>

You will also require

- gcc >4.9 or equivalent
- gcc libstdc++ >4.9

You probably already have boost, HDF5 and dlib (as long as you did clone --recursive).

### Installation on Ubuntu/biolinux

Running the following commands will install seer

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install g++-4.9 libhdf5-dev libopenblas-dev libboost-program-options-dev

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/johnlees/seer
    cd seer

    wget http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/compgeom/gzstream/gzstream.tgz
    tar xzf gzstream.tgz
    cd gzstream &&make CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.9
    cd ..

    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/arma/files/armadillo-6.700.6.tar.gz
    tar xzf armadillo-6.700.6.tar.gz
    cd armadillo-6.700.6
    CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.9 cmake .
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig /usr/lib64
    cd ..
    cd src && make CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.9

### General installation instructions

**gzstream**

Download and unpack to a folder gzstream in the root of the repository. Change into the directory and type

    make

**HDF5**

Best installed with your distribution's package manager. Otherwise use
a binary from <https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html>, or
if you wish to compile from source

    gunzip < hdf5-X.Y.Z.tar.gz | tar xf -
    cd hdf5-X.Y.Z
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 <more configure_flags>
    make
    make check
    make install
    make check-install

**armadillo**

Make sure HDF5 is installed first.

Download and unpack. Change into directory and type

    cmake -DARMA_USE_HDF5=1 .
    make
    make install

**boost**

Best installed with your distribution's package manager, and you should use the c++11 version if possible.

For a manual installation, see <http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html> for details on how to use ./b2 to install. I recommend that you create a user-config.jam file in the boost root which modifies the gcc compilation:

    using gcc:
      : std11
      : g++
      : <cxxflags>-std=c++11

Then run

    ./bootstrap.sh
    ./b2 install toolset=gcc-std11


**dlib**

If not installed use the above git clone command to include with the
repository. Otherwise unpack header files to $(PREFIX)/include

**installation**

Currently tested on Linux only, installation should proceed as

    make
    make install

You may need to explicitly set the current GCC compiler, which you can
do by running

    make CXX=g++-4.9
